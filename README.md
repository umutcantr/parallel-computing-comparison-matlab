# Parallel computing comparison matlab

 Apply image filter sequentially and parallel. Compare execution time of these two function.

 # How it works
 - Apply gaussian filter to given image sequentially and save execution time
 - Apply gaussian filter to given image parallel and save execution time
 - Compare these two methods execution time and efficiency
